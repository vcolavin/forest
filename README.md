# A RESTful forest

Haha, get it?

Anyways, this is the API back end for a solo personal project currently under active development. It's built off [rails-api](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) and doesn't involve any unusually complex setup.

Inspired by certain aspects of Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft. At least at first, it'll be a read-only experience where someone can walk through a (hopefully) rich environment, looking closely at objects, their histories, and relationships with each other. I'd love for the API to be fully RESTful and follow HATEOAS, so that someone could explore the forest through the API alone.

I intend on building a decoupled front end for this forest.
